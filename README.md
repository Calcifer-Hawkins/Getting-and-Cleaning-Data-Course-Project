# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Repo for the submission of Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project: prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis (by using raw data the course assignment supplied).

## Overview
This project serves to demonstrate the collection and cleaning of a tidy data set that can be used for subsequent analysis. 

[The source data for this project can be found here.](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

## Making Modifications to This Script
Once you have obtained and unzipped the source files, you will need to make one modification to the R file before you can process the data.
Note that on line 24 of run_analysis.R, you will set the path of the working directory to relect the location of the source files in your own directory.

## Project Summary
The following is a summary description of the project instructions

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive variable names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

## Additional Information
You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
